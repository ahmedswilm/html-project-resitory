  <h1>low level language</h1>
  <b>This language is the most reasonable language utilized by PC to play out its activities. It tends to be additionally sorted into:</b>
  <ol>
<li><h2>Machine Language (1GL)</h2></li>
<b>Machine language comprises of strings of twofold numbers (for example 0s and 1s) and it is the just a single language, the processor straightforwardly gets it. Machine language has a Merits of extremely quick execution speed and productive utilization of essential memory.</b>
<h3>Merits</h3>
<b>It is directly understood by the processor so has faster execution time since the programs written in this language need not to be tanslated.
     It doesn’t need larger memory.</b>
<h3>Demerits:</h3>
<b> It is very difficult to program using 1GL since all the instructions are to be represented by 0s and 1s.
      Use of this language makes programming time consuming.
    It is difficult to find error and to debug     It can be used by experts only.</b>
	<li><h2> Assembly Language</h2></li>
	<b>Assembly language is also known as low-level language because to design a program programmer requires detailed knowledge of hardware specification. This language uses mnemonics code (symbolic operation code like ‘ADD’ for addition) in place of 0s and 1s. The program is converted into machine code by assembler. The resulting program is reffered to as an object code.</b>
	<h3>Merits</h3>
	<b>It is makes programming simpler than 1GL since it utilizes memory helpers code for programming. Eg: ADD for option, SUB for deduction, DIV for division, and so on. 

It makes programming process quicker. 

Blunder can be recognized much effortlessly contrasted with 1GL. 

It is simpler to investigate than machine language.</b>
<h3>Demerits</h3>
<b>Projects written in this language isn't legitimately reasonable by PC so translaters ought to be utilized. 

 It is equipment subordinate language so software engineers are compelled to think regarding PC's design as opposed to the issue being comprehended. 

 Being machine subordinate language, programs written in this language are less or not protable. 

Software engineers must realize its mental aides codes to play out any assignment.</b>
</ol>
<h1>high level languages</h1>
<b>Guidelines of this language intently looks like to human language or English like words. It utilizes numerical documentations to play out the errand. The significant level language is simpler to learn. It requires less an ideal opportunity to compose and is simpler to keep up the mistakes. The elevated level language is changed over into machine language by one of the two distinct dialects interpreter programs; mediator or compiler.</b>
<p><b>High level language can be further categorized as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>   <h2> Procedural-Oriented language (3GL)</h2> </li>
<b>Procedural Programming is a system for demonstrating the issue being settled, by deciding the means and the request for those means that must be followed so as to arrive at an ideal result or explicit program state. These dialects are intended to communicate the rationale and the system of an issue to be illuminated. It incorporates dialects, for example, Pascal, COBOL, C, FORTAN, and so on.</b>
<h3>Merits</h3>
<b>Due to their adaptability, procedural dialects can take care of an assortment of issues. 

Developer doesn't have to think in term of PC engineering which makes them concentrated on the issue. 

Projects written in this language are convenient.</b>
<h3>Demirts</h3>
<b> It is easier but needs higher processor and larger memory.

      It needs to be translated therefore its execution time is more</b>
<li> <h2>Problem-Oriented language (4GL)</h2> </li>
<b>It allows the users to specify what the output should be, without describing all the details of how the data should be manupulated to produce the result. This is one step ahead from 3GL. These are result oriented and include database query language.
Eg: Visual Basic, C#, PHP, etc.
The objectives of 4GL are to:
  Increase the speed of developing programs.
  Minimize user’s effort to botain information from computer.
  Reduce errors while writing programs.</b>
  <h3>Merirts</h3>
  <b>Programmer need not to think about the procedure of the program. So, programming is much easier.</b>
  <h3>Demirts</h3>
  <b> It is easier but needs higher processor and larger memory.

      It needs to be translated therefore its execution time is more.</b>
	  <li><h2>Natural language (5GL)</h2></li>
	  <b>Natural language are stil in developing stage where we could write statrments that would look like normal sentences.</b>
	  <h3>Merites</h3>
	  <b>Simple to program. 

Since, the program utilizes ordinary sentences, they are straightforward. 

The projects structured utilizing 5GL will have computerized reasoning (AI). 

The projects would be considerably more intuitive and fascinating.</b>
<h3>Demirtes</h3>
<b>It is more slow than past age language as it ought to be totally converted into double code which is a dreary undertaking. 

Profoundly progressed and costly electronic gadgets are required to run programs created in 5GL. Along these lines, it is a costly methodology.</b>
</ol>
<b>These are the different types of programming languages with their merits and demerits.</b>

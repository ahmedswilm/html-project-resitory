<p><b>A program is a lot of guidelines given to a PC to play out a particular activity. or on the other hand PC is a computational gadget which is utilized to process the information heavily influenced by a PC program.While executing the program, crude information is handled into an ideal yield design. These PC programs are written in a programming language which are significant level dialects. Significant level dialects are about human dialects which are increasingly mind boggling then the PC justifiable language which are called machine language, or low level language.So subsequent to knowing the rudiments, we are prepared to make a basic and essential program. Like we have various dialects to speak with one another, in like manner, we have various dialects like C, C++, C#, Java, python, and so forth to speak with the PCs. The PC just comprehends paired language (the language of 0's and 1's) likewise called machine-justifiable language or low-level language yet the projects we will compose are in an elevated level language which is practically like human language.

<h2>Characteristics of a programming Language</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>A programming language must be simple, easy to learn and use, have good readability and human recognizable.</b></li>
<li><b>Abstraction is a must-have Characteristics for a programming language in which ability to define the complex structure and then its degree of usability comes.</b></li>
<li><b>A portable programming language is always preferred.</b></li>
<li><b>Programming languageâ€™s efficiency must be high so that it can be easily converted into a machine code and executed consumes little space in memory.</b></li>
<li><b>A programming language should be well structured and documented so that it is suitable for application development.</b></li>
<li><b>Necessary tools for development, debugging, testing, maintenance of a program must be provided by a programming language.</b></li>
<li><b>A programming language should provide single environment known as Integrated Development Environment(IDE).</b></li>
<li><b>A programming language must be consistent in terms of syntax and semantics.</b></li>
